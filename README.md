# PokeViewer-v2
# React + Vite

This is a simple React app that takes user input and fetches Pokemon images and data from [PokeAPI.co](https://pokeapi.co/), performs unit conversions for height and weight, and display that data on the screen. The search bar provides autocomplete suggestions once the user types in 3 characters. The app loads up Lopunny by default because it's my favorite. 

The live app is available here: [https://drewm64.github.io/PokeViewer-v2/](https://drewm64.github.io/PokeViewer-v2/)
